## CORE GAME MECHANICS

### Challenge Resolution System
The heart of the game is overcoming challenges at each Landscape. Challenges represent obstacles, guardians, or trials you must face to progress on your journey.

These spiritual animals can join your journey, offering unique abilities that help overcome challenges, but they require care and feeding.

### Crafting System
By combining specific resources, you can create powerful magical items that grant special abilities, though each comes with a drawback.

### Seasonal Cycle
The Celtic year turns as you progress, affecting challenge difficulties, resource availability, and offering unique opportunities.

### Threat Accumulation
Certain actions and failures increase the spiritual imbalance of your journey, represented by Threat tokens. Managing this threat is vital for success.
