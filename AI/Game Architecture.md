how the Vue.js system is implemented in this application:

Vue 3 with the Composition API (seen in the App.vue with script setup)
Pinia for state management (seen in the stores)
Vue Router for navigation
TypeScript integration
Component-based architecture with a clear separation of concerns
Vue.js System Implementation in Pathfinder's Journey
Vue 3 with Composition API - The application uses Vue 3's script setup syntax in components and the latest Composition API patterns for better code organization and type safety
Pinia State Management - Implements Pinia stores for game state (gameStore), player data (playerStore), and card management (cardStore) with well-defined actions, getters, and state
Component-Based Architecture - Uses a hierarchical component structure with specialized components for different game elements (e.g., GameCard.vue, LandscapeView.vue, CompanionCard.vue)
TypeScript Integration - Full TypeScript implementation with strong typing for game models, enums, and interfaces to ensure type safety and developer experience
Composable Functions - Leverages custom composables like useGameState to encapsulate and reuse logic across components, providing a unified interface to interact with multiple stores
