## CORE GAME MECHANICS

### Challenge Resolution System
The heart of the game is overcoming challenges at each Landscape. Challenges represent obstacles, guardians, or trials you must face to progress on your journey.

### Resource Management
Gathering, carrying, and using resources wisely is crucial. Resources are used to feed Animal Companions, craft magical items, and sometimes overcome specific challenges.

### Animal Companions
These spiritual animals can join your journey, offering unique abilities that help overcome challenges, but they require care and feeding.

### Crafting System
By combining specific resources, you can create powerful magical items that grant special abilities, though each comes with a drawback.

### Seasonal Cycle
The Celtic year turns as you progress, affecting challenge difficulties, resource availability, and offering unique opportunities.

### Threat Accumulation
Certain actions and failures increase the spiritual imbalance of your journey, represented by Threat tokens. Managing this threat is vital for success.
